\textbf{abstract class}

A class for which the creation of concrete objects (instances) is impossible. Abstract classes can be used to collect common properties of different classes in a single type or to define a polymorphic interface. Because abstract classes are used as base classes, the acronym ABC is sometimes used for abstract base class.

\textbf{ADL}

An acronym for argument-dependent lookup. ADL is a process that looks for a name of a function (or operator) in namespaces and classes that are in some way associated with the arguments of the function call in which that function (or operator name) appears. For historical reasons, it is sometimes called extended Koenig lookup or just Koenig lookup (the latter is also used for ADL applied to operators only).
