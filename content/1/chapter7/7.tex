\begin{itemize}
\item 
When testing templates, use string literals of different length.

\item 
Template parameters passed by value decay, while passing them by reference does not decay.

\item 
The type trait std::decay<> allows you to decay parameters in templates passed by reference.

\item 
In some cases std::cref() and std::ref() allow you to pass arguments by reference when function templates declare them to be passed by value.

\item 
Passing template parameters by value is simple but may not result in the best performance.

\item 
Pass parameters to function templates by value unless there are good reasons to do otherwise.

\item 
Ensure that return values are usually passed by value (which might mean that a template parameter can’t be specified directly as a return type).

\item 
Always measure performance when it is important. Do not rely on intuition; it’s probably wrong.
