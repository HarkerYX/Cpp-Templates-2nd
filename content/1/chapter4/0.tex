Since C++11, templates can have parameters that accept a variable number of template arguments. This feature allows the use of templates in places where you have to pass an arbitrary number of arguments of arbitrary types. A typical application is to pass an arbitrary number of parameters of arbitrary type through a class or framework. Another application is to provide generic code to process any number of parameters of any type.
