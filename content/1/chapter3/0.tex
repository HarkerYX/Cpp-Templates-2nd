For function and class templates, template parameters donâ€™t have to be types. They can also be ordinary values. As with templates using type parameters, you define code for which a certain detail remains open until the code is used. However, the detail that is open is a value instead of a type. When using such a template, you have to specify this value explicitly. The resulting code then gets instantiated. This chapter illustrates this feature for a new version of the stack class template. In addition, we show an example of nontype function template parameters and discuss some restrictions to this technique.
