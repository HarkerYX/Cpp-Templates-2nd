\begin{itemize}
\item 
A class template is a class that is implemented with one or more type parameters left open.

\item 
To use a class template, you pass the open types as template arguments. The class template is then instantiated (and compiled) for these types.

\item 
For class templates, only those member functions that are called are instantiated.

\item 
You can specialize class templates for certain types.

\item 
You can partially specialize class templates for certain types.

\item 
Since C++17, class template arguments can automatically be deduced from constructors.

\item 
You can define aggregate class templates.

\item 
Call parameters of a template type decay if declared to be called by value.

\item 
Templates can only be declared and defined in global/namespace scope or inside class declarations.
