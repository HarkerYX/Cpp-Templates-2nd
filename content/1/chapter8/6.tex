\begin{itemize}
\item 
Templates provide the ability to compute at compile time (using recursion to iterate and partial specialization or operator ?: for selections).

\item 
With constexpr functions, we can replace most compile-time computations with “ordinary functions” that are callable in compile-time contexts.

\item 
With partial specialization, we can choose between different implementations of class templates based on certain compile-time constraints.

\item 
Templates are used only if needed and substitutions in function template declarations do not result in invalid code. This principle is called SFINAE (substitution failure is not an error).

\item 
SFINAE can be used to provide function templates only for certain types and/or constraints.

\item 
Since C++17, a compile-time if allows us to enable or discard statements according to compiletime conditions (even outside templates).
