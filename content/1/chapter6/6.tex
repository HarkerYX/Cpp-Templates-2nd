\begin{itemize}
\item 
In templates, you can “perfectly” forward parameters by declaring them as forwarding references (declared with a type formed with the name of a template parameter followed by \&\&) and using std::forward<>() in the forwarded call.

\item 
When using perfect forwarding member function templates, they might match better than the predefined special member function to copy or move objects.

\item 
With std::enable\_if<>, you can disable a function template when a compile-time condition is false (the template is then ignored once that condition has been determined).

\item 
By using std::enable\_if<> you can avoid problems when constructor templates or assignment operator templates that can be called for single arguments are a better match than implicitly generated special member functions.

\item 
You can templify (and apply enable\_if<>) to special member functions by deleting the predefined special member functions for const volatile.

\item 
Concepts will allow us to use a more intuitive syntax for requirements on function templates.
