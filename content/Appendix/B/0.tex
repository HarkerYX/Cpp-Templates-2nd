Expressions are a cornerstone of the C++ language, providing the primary mechanism by which it can express computations. Every expression has a type, which describes the static type of the value that its computation produces. The expression 7 has type int, as does the expression 5 + 2, and the expression x if x is a variable of type int. Each expression also has a value category, which describes something about how the value was formed and affects how the expression behaves.
