Type erasure provides some of the advantages of both static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism, but not all. In particular, the performance of generated code using type erasure hews more closely to that of dynamic polymorphism, because both use dynamic dispatch via virtual functions. Thus, some of the traditional advantages of static polymorphism, such as the ability of the compiler to inline calls, may be lost. Whether this loss of performance will be perceptible is applicationdependent, but it’s often easy to tell by considering how much work is performed in the function being called relative to the cost of a virtual function call: If the two are close (e.g., using FunctionPtr to simply add two integers), type erasure is likely to execute far more slowly than a static-polymorphic version. If, on the other hand, the function call performs a significant amount of work—querying a database, sorting a container, or updating a user interface—the overhead of type erasure is unlikely to be measurable.
