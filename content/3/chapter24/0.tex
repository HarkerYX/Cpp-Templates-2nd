Effective programming typically requires the use of various data structures, and metaprogramming is no different. For type metaprogramming, the central data structure is the typelist, which, as its name implies, is a list containing types. Template metaprograms can operate on these lists of types, manipulating them to eventually produce a part of the executable program. In this chapter, we discuss techniques for working with typelists. Since most operations involving typelists make use of template metaprogramming, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with metaprogramming, as discussed in Chapter 23.
