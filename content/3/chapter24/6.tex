Typelists seem to have sprung forth shortly after the first C++ standard was published in 1998. Krysztof Czarnecki and Ulrich Eisenecker introduced a LISP-inspired Cons style list of integral constants in [CzarneckiEiseneckerGenProg], although they did not make the leap to general typelists.

Alexandrescu popularized typelists in his influential book Modern C++ Design ([AlexandrescuDesign]). Above all, Alexandrescu demonstrated the versatility of typelists for solving interesting design problems with template metaprogramming and typelists, making these techniques accessible to C++ programmers.

Abrahams and Gurtovoy provided much-needed structure for metaprogramming in [AbrahamsGurtovoyMeta], describing abstractions for typelists, typelist algorithms, and related components in familiar terms drawn from the C++ standard library: sequences, iterators, algorithms, and (meta)functions. The accompanying library, Boost.MPL ([BoostMPL]), is widely used for manipulating typelists.
