A fairly systematic attempt to improve C++ compiler diagnostics by adding dummy code in highlevel templates can be found in Jeremy Siekâ€™s Concept Check Library (see [BCCL]). It is part of  the Boost library (see [Boost]).

Robert Klarer and John Maddock proposed the static\_assert feature to help programmers check conditions at compile time. It was among the earliest features added to what would later become C++11. Prior to that, it was commonly expressed as a library or macro using techniques similar to those described in Section 28.1 on page 652. The Boost.StaticAssert library is one such implementation.

The MELAS system provided oracles for certain parts of the C++ standard library, allowing verification of some of its algorithms. This system is discussed in [MusserWangDynaVeri].

\hspace*{0.75cm}One author, David Musser, was also a key figure in the development of the C++ standard library. Among other things, he designed and implemented the first associative containers.
