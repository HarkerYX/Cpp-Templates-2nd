The first part of this book provided a tutorial for most of the language concepts underlying C++ templates. That presentation is sufficient to answer most questions that may arise in everyday C++ programming. The second part of this book provides a reference that answers even the more unusual questions that arise when pushing the envelope of the language to achieve some advanced software effects. If desired, you can skip this part on a first read and return to specific topics as prompted by references in later chapters or after looking up a concept in the index.
