There are many small details to looking up names in C++, but we will focus only on a few major concepts. The details are necessary to ensure only that (1) normal cases are treated intuitively, and (2) pathological cases are covered in some way by the standard.

Qualified names are looked up in the scope implied by the qualifying construct. If that scope is a class, then base classes may also be searched. However, enclosing scopes are not considered when looking up qualified names. The following illustrates this basic principle:
